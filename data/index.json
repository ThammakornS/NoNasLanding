We build web tools that tackle the messy, overlooked, and just plain annoying parts of data work—like missing values, clunky prep, and the pain of trial-and-error modeling. Our tools aren’t trying to be everything. They’re sharp, focused, and built for folks who’d rather spend time thinking than cleaning.",
